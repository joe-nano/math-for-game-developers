# Math for Game Developers

Code examples for using mathematics for game development, based on Jorge Rodriguez' [series of videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My).

I took Jorge's C++ code from the videos and ported it to JavaScript (ECMAScript2015). You can use the [Vector](Vector.js) and [Point](Point.js) modules in your own projects by using a transpiler such as [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).

## Installation

Use the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for running the code (at least v5.4).

On the command line, simply type:

    npm start
