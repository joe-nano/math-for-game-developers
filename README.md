# Math for Game Developers

Code examples for using mathematics for game development, based on Jorge Rodriguez' [series of videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW3Zl3wyJwWOpdhYedlD-yCB7WQoHf-My).

I took Jorge's C++ code from the videos and ported it to JavaScript (ECMAScript2015). 
You can use the [Vector](js/math/Vector.js) and [Point](js/math/Point.js) modules in your own projects by using a transpiler such as [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).

## Installation

Use the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for running the code (at least v5.4).

Install using npm:

    npm install

The examples 1-9 you can simply run with Node.js, on the command line, e.g. type:

    node js/01_character-movement.js
    
Example 11 has graphics, you can run it in your browser by opening the HTML file.
